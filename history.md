## Overview

LEGO engines have arguably been possible since the dawn of LEGO Technic (a. k. a. Expert Builder upon its conception). This leaves the possibility that the first use of LEGO for making engines could have been as early as 1977, but the progression of their development expanded greatly from simple aesthetic models, to larger complex mechanical assemblies which resemble real engines in either the function or visual appeal of each of their parts.

## LEGO Group & Fake Engines

[Also read: LEGO Fake Engines](https://lego-engines.fandom.com/wiki/LEGO_Fake_Engines)

The LEGO Group has made a few sets which featured engines. One of the earliest and most iconic was the 1980 Auto Engines 858 set. This set could have had an inspiration in the making of the original LEGO engines which convert a form of energy into mechanical energy (air powered). The LEGO Group has never made this kind of power-producing engine as an official LEGO set possibly due to the potential harm that running engines pose to the plastic. However many Expert Builder and Technic sets have featured fake engines of two main varieties: those with square pistons and those with round pistons. Less common were brick-built engines that were fully assembled using non-specialty bricks as is common with many LEGO vacuum engines.

**Square Piston Fake Engine**
This type of engine was first featured at the dawn of the Expert Builder era in the 853 Auto Chassis set. It requires a special square piston part inside of a brick-made cylinder assembly along with a Technic connector that clipped into the underside of the piston part.

**Round Piston Fake Engine**
The most popular kind of LEGO fake engine is the round piston fake engine known for its yellow colored round pistons appearing in numerous Technic vehicles. It is one of the most popular types of engines to feature in many car MOCs made by LEGO fans today.

**Brick-Built Fake Engines**
The 10269 Harley Davidson Fatboy set from 2019 features an entirely brick-built LEGO engine which turns over as the rear tire rotates via a drive chain.
