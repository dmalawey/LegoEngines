## Overview

A LEGO vacuum engine (LVE) is a type of LEGO high volume low pressure, air powered LEGO engine that uses a vacuum cleaner as its source of air flow. It is the most common type of LEGO air powered engine on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok because of the widespread availability of both a vacuum cleaner and the LEGO parts to build it.

### Variation in Terminology
In the first two decades of LEGO high volume low pressure engines, the term "LEGO vacuum engine" was the term used by the LEGO engine building community to describe most HVLP engines. However, when engine builders began experimenting with boosting engines using sources of both positive and negative pressure airflow (e.g. using the inlet and outlet of a wet/dry vacuum), the all-encompassing term HVLP emerged to avoid confusion as to whether an engine ran on suction or positive pressure. Most still affectionately use the term LEGO vacuum engine (LVE) as a term to describe the HVLP category of LEGO engine even if their airflow source used to power the engine is not a vacuum cleaner (e.g. hair dryer).
