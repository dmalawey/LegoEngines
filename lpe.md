## Overview
A LEGO pneumatic engine (LPE) is a LEGO engine which operates on compressed air using LEGO pneumatic parts for their primary piston-cylinder assembly. Because a LEGO pneumatic engines' powering device is an air compressor, they usually require airtight sealing between piston and cylinder to prevent the tank on the air compressor from emptying from a higher than necessary flow rate.

## Disambiguation
Though the term "pneumatic" simply means "of, relating to, or using gas (such as air or wind) [...] moved or worked by air pressure,"[3] it's usage in the LEGO engine community refers to engines which utilize the LEGO pneumatic parts.[4] To avoid confusion, the umbrella term "air powered LEGO engine" refers to both high volume low pressure and high pressure low volume LEGO engines.
